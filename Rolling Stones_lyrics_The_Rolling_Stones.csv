Route 66 Lyrics","[Intro]
Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way that is the highway that is the best

[Verse]
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well it winds from Chicago to L.A
More than 2000 miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

[Chorus][x2]
Well goes from St. Louie down to Missouri
Oklahoma city looks oh so pretty
You will see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66"

Carol Lyrics","[Chorus]
Oh, Carol
Do not let him steal your heart away
I am going to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

[Verse]
Climb into my machine so we can groove on out
I know some swinging little joint where we can jump and shout
It is not too far back on the highway not so long a ride
You park the car out in the open you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her ma'am
Because every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed
Oh, Carol
Do not let him steal your heart away
I am going to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day
Now, if you want to hear some music like the boys are playing
Hold tight, bang your foot do not let it carry you away
Do not let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Will the music intrigue you when they get a crowd
Well you cannot dance I know you would you could
I got my eyes on you, baby, cause you dance so good

[Chorus][x2]"

I wait as the days go by
I long for the nights to go by
I hear the knock on my door that never comes
I hear the telephone that has not rung

Can I Get A Witness Lyrics","[Intro]
Ah ah listen to everybody (body)
Especially you girls (girl)

[Verse 1]
It is not right to be left alone
When the one you love is never home
I loved to hard my friends sometime say
But I believe, I believe
That a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see you treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere tell her it is not fair

[Chorus]
Can I get a witness (can I get a witness)
I want a witness (can I get a witness)
I want a witness (can I get a witness)
Somebody (can I get a witness)
Is it right to be treated so bad
When you give it everything you had

[Verse 2]
If I talks in my sleep
Because I have not seen my baby all week
Now you chicks you all agree
This is no the way it is supposed to be
Let me hear you
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah
Up early in the morning
Well they are all in my mind
Just to find her out all night
Well I have been crying
But I believe
A women is a man's best friend
I am going to stick by her
Until the very end
Well she caused me so much misery
I forget how it is supposed to be
Somebody, somewhere
Tell her it is no fair

But half a loves is twice as bad

I want a witness (can I get a witness)

Walking The Dog Lyrics","[Intro]
Baby, back
Dressed in black
Silver buttons all down her back
High hose, tippy toes
She broke the needle and she can sew
Walking the dog

I am just a walking the dog
If you do not know how to do it
I will show you how to walk the dog
Come on now come on

I asked her mother for fifteen cents
I see you ever jumped the fence
I jumped so high, touched the skies
Did not get back until a quarter to five
Walking the dog

Tell me Mary, what is your twelve
How does your garden grow
What with silver bells and cockle shells
And pretty maids all in a row
Walking the dog

Dressed in black
Silver buttons all down her back
High hose, tippy toes
She broke the needle and she can sew
Walking the dog

You Better Move On Lyrics","[Verse 1]
You ask me to give up the hand of the girl I love
You tell me, I'm not the man she's worthy of
But who are you to tell her who to love?
That's up to her, yes, and the Lord above
You better move on

[Verse 2]
Well, I know you can buy her fancy clothes and diamond rings
But I believe she's happy with me, without those things
Still you beg me to set her free
But, my friend, that will never be
You better move on

[Bridge]
Now I don't blame you for loving her
But can't you understand, man, she's my girl
And I, I'm never never ever gonna let her go
Because I, yeah, I love her so

[Verse 3]
I think you better go now, I'm getting mighty mad
You ask me to give up the only love I've ever had
Maybe I would, oh, but I love her so
I'm never gonna let her go
You better move on

[Outro]
You better move on[x3]"

Bye Bye Johnny Lyrics","Well she drew out all her money out from southern trust
And put a little boy aboard a greyhound bus
Leaving Lousiana for the golden west
Down came her tears from her happiness
Her own little son named Johnny B Goode
Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood

Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode

Well she remember taking money out from gathering crops
And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop
As long as he could play it by the railroad side
And wouldn't get in trouble she'd be satisfied
Never thought there'd ever come a day like this
When she would gladly give her son a goodbye kiss

Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode

Well she finally got the letter she was dreaming of
Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love
As soon as he was married he would bring her back
And build a mansion for her by the railroad tracks
And everytime they heard the locomotive roar
They'd be a standing, waving in the kitchen door

Howling bye bye bye bye
Now bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode"
