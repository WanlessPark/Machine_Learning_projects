Mercy Mercy Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
Well I went to see the gypsy
To have my fortune read
She said Man, your baby going to leave you
Her bags are packed up under the bed

[Chorus]
That's right
Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me

[Verse 2]
But if you leave me baby
Girl if you put me down
I'm going to make it to the nearest river child
And jump overboard and drown

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I said hey hey baby, hey hey now
What you trying to do
Hey hey baby, hey hey now
Please don't say we're through
Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
But if you stay baby
I tell you what I'm going to do
I'm going to work two jobs, seven days a week
And bring my money home to you

[Chorus][x2]"

The Last Time Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well I told you once and I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know it should be easy

[Chorus]
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know. Oh no. Oh no

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm sorry girl but I can't stay
Feeling like I do today
It's too much pain and too much sorrow
Guess I'll feel the same tomorrow

Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know. Oh no. Oh no
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time

Well I told you once and I told you twice
That someone will have to pay the price
But here's a chance to change your mind
Because I'll be gone a long, long time

That's How Strong My Love Is Lyrics","[Verse 1]
If I was the sun way up there
I'd go with my love everywhere
I'll be the moon when the sun go down
To let you know I'm still around

That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is

You can go swimming when you're here
I'll be the rainbow when the sun is gone
Wrap you in my colors and keep you warm

I'll be the ocean so deep and wide
I'll dry the tears when you cry
I'll be the breeze when the storm is gone
To dry your eyes and keep you warm

Good Times Lyrics","Whoa la la ta ta
Whoa la la ta ta
La la la all night long
Wanna tell you

Whoa la la ta ta
Whoa la la ta ta
La la la all night long

C'mon let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here to soothe our soul
It could take all night long

The evening sun is sinking low
The clock on the wall says it's time to go
I've got my plans I don't know about you
I tell you exactly what I'm gonna do

Get in the groove and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here to soothe our soul
It could take all night long

It might be one o'clock it might be three
Time don't mean that much to me
Ain't felt this good since I don't know when
I might not feel this good again

So c'mon let the good time roll
We're gonna stay here to soothe our soul
It could take all night long

All night, all night
All night, all night long
Somebody said it might take all night long
All night, all night whoa

We're gonna stay here to soothe our soul
It could take all night long"

(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Lyrics","[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Verse 1]
When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no - oh no, no, no!
Hey hey hey! That's what I say!

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Verse 2]
When I'm watching my TV
And that man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Outro]
When I'm riding round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby, better come back, maybe next week
Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey! That's what I say!"

Cry to Me Lyrics","[Verse 1]
When your baby leaves you all alone
And nobody call you on the phone

[Chorus]
Don’t you feel like crying?
Don’t you feel like crying, like crying, like crying?
Come on baby, cry to me

[Verse 2]
When you're all alone in your lonely room
And there's nothing but the smell of her perfume

[Chorus]
Don’t you feel like crying?
Don’t you feel like crying, like crying, like crying?
Come on baby, cry to me

[Verse 3]
Nothing could be sadder than a glass of wine alone
Loneliness, loneliness, it just a waste of your time
But you don't ever, you don't ever have to walk alone
You see, so c'mon, take my hand
Come on walk with me
When you're waiting for a voice to come
In the night there is no one

[Chorus]
Don’t you feel like crying?
Don’t you feel like crying, like crying, like crying?
Come on baby, cry to me

[Verse 4]
Yes, I want you to come on baby

The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well I'm waiting at the bus stop in downtown L.A
Well I'm waiting at the bus stop in downtown L.A

Play With Fire Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your car
You let everybody know
But don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire
Your mother she's an heiress, owns a block in Saint John's Wood
And your father'd be there with her
If he only could
But don't play with me, because you're playing with fire
Your old man took her diamond's and tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge anymore
So don't play with me, because you're playing with fire
Now you've got some diamonds and you will have some others
But you'd better watch your step, girl
Or start living with your mother
So don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire
So don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire"
"
The Spider And The Fly Lyrics","[Chorus 1]
Sitting thinking sinking drinking
Wondering what I'd do when I'm through tonight
Smoking moping, maybe just hoping
Some little girl will pass on by
Don't want to be alone but I love my girl at home
I remember what she said
She said, My, my, my don't tell lies, keep fidelity in your head
My my my, don't tell lies, When you're done you should go to bed
Don't say hi, like a spider to a fly
Jump right ahead and you're dead

[Chorus 2]
Sit up, fed up, low down go round
Down to the bar at the place I'm at
Sitting drinking, superficially thinking
About the rinsed-out blonde on my left
Then I said, hi, like a spider to a fly
Remembering what my little girl said

[Chorus 3]
She was common, flirty, she looked about thirty
I would have run away but I was on my own
She told me later she's a machine operator
She said she liked the way I held the microphone
Then I said hi like a spider to a fly
Jump right ahead in my web

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]"

One More Try Lyrics","[Verse 1]
You need some money in a hurry
But things isn’t right
You try to beg and borrow maybe start a fight
Your friends don't want to know you they just pass you by
So they couldn't be your friends because they wouldn't lie

[Chorus]
Sit down shut up don't dare to cry
Things will get better if you really try
So don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try
Don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try

[Verse 2]
You got to girl that doesn't bring you all she cries
The day turns into night to try to satisfy
You buy her all the things she want she don't improve
You think you'd give her up if you could make that move

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The things that don't matter easy come and go
And the things that satisfy only come real slow
You got to know and watch it all in your mind
Cause it's better when you get it if you really try

[Chorus]
Sit down shut up don't dare to cry
Things will get better if you really try
So don't y you a panic don't you  panic
Give it one more try
Don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try
Keep on trying[x5]
You got to keep trying"

Gotta Get Away Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Baby, the truth is out so don't deny
Baby to think I believed all your lies
Darlin' I can't stand to see your face
It's the truth, you understand

[Chorus]
I got to get away, got to get away
Got to, got to, got to get away
Got to get away

[Verse 2]

Baby, though I tore your pictures off my walls
Darling this old room's falling in on me
You understand the truth now

[Chorus]

Baby, don't screw up this old heart of gold
Darling, this will rule my social flare
You understand me now
