Two of Us Lyrics","I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats

[Verse 1]
Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2]
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 3]
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 4]
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Outro]
We're going home
Better believe it
Goodbye"

Dig a Pony Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I dig a pony
Well, you can celebrate anything you want
Yes, you can celebrate anything you want
Oh!

I do a road hog
Well you can penetrate any place you go
Yes you can penetrate any place you go

[Chorus]
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Verse 2]
I pick a moon dog
Well you can radiate everything you are
Yes you can radiate everything you are

Oh now
I roll a stoney
Well you can imitate everyone you know
Yes you can imitate everyone you know

[Chorus]
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Verse 3]
Ooh now
I feel the wind blow
Well you can indicate everything you see
Yes you can indicate everything you see

Oh now
I load a lorry
Well you can syndicate any boat you row
Yeah you can syndicate any boat you row

[Chorus]
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because"

Across the Universe Lyrics","[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on, across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Outro: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva"

I Me Mine Lyrics","[Verse 1]
All through the day, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
All through the night, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day I me mine

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine

Even those tears, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day I me mine

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine

[Verse 2]
All I can hear, I me mine

Dig It Lyrics","[Verse]
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like the FBI
And the CIA
And the BBC
B.B. King
And Doris Day
Matt Busby, dig it, dig it

That was ""Can You Dig It"" by Georgie Wood, and now we'd like to do ""Hark the Angels Come"""

Let It Be Lyrics","[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
“Let it be”
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
“Let it be”

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
And when the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on till tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom

One After 909 Lyrics","[Chorus 1]
My baby says she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Chorus 2]
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, you're only fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Verse]
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

The Long and Winding Road Lyrics","[Verse 1]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before it always leads me here
Leads me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting), lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

Sweet Loretta Fart she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan
Sweet Rosetta Martin... Rosetta
