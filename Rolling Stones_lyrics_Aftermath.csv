Mother's Little Helper Lyrics","[Intro]
What a drag it is getting old

[Verse 1]
Things are different today"", I hear every mother say
Mother needs something today to calm her down
And though she's not really ill, there's a little yellow pill

[Refrain]
She goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day

[Verse 2]
""Things are different today"", I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for a husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake and she burns a frozen steak

[Refrain]
And goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And to help her on her way, get her through her busy day

[Chorus]
Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

[Verse 3]
""Men just aren't the same today"", I hear every mother say
""They just don't appreciate that you get tired""
""They're so hard to satisfy"", you can tranquilize your mind

[Refrain]
So go running for the shelter of your mother's little helper
And four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight

[Chorus]
Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

[Verse 4]
""Life's just much too hard today"", I hear ev'ry mother say
The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
And if you take more of those, you will get an overdose

[Refrain]
No more running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
They just helped you on your way through your busy dying day

Hey"

Stupid Girl Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I'm not talking about the kind of clothes she wears
Look at that stupid girl
I'm not talking about the way she combs her hair
Look at that stupid girl

The way she powders her nose
Her vanity shows and it shows
She's the worst thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl

[Verse 2]
I'm not talking about the way she digs for gold
Look at that stupid girl
Well, I'm talking about the way she grabs and holds
Look at that stupid girl

The way she talks about someone else
That she don't even know herself
She's the sickest thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl

[Chorus]
Well, I'm sick and tired and I really have my doubts
I've tried and tried, but it never really works out

[Verse 3]
Like a lady-in-waiting to a virgin queen
Look at that stupid girl
She bitches about things that she's never seen
Look at that stupid girl

It doesn't matter if she dyes her hair
Or the color of the shoes she wears
She's the worst thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl

[Guitar Break]

[Verse 4]
Like a lady-in-waiting to a virgin queen
Look at that stupid girl
She bitches about things that she's never seen
Look at that stupid girl

And she purrs like a pussycat
Then she turns around and hisses back
She's the sickest thing in this world
Look at that stupid girl"

Lady Jane Lyrics","[Verse 1]
My sweet Lady Jane, when I see you again
Your servant am I and will humbly remain
Just heed this plea, my love
On bended knees, my love
I pledge myself to lady Jane

[Verse 2]
My dear lady Anne, I've done what I can
I must take my leave for promised I am
This play is run, my love
Your time has come, my love
I pledge my troth to lady Jane

[Verse 3]
Oh my sweet Marie, I wait at your eaves
The sands have run out for your lady and me
When luck is nigh, my love
Her station's right, my love
Life is secure with lady Jane"

Under My Thumb Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Under my thumb the girl who once had me down
Under my thumb the girl who once pushed me around

[Chorus]
It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Say it's all right

[Verse 2]
Under my thumb the squirming dog who's just had her day
Under my thumb a girl who has just changed her ways

It's down to me, yes it is
The way she does just what she's told
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Ah, ah, say it's alright

[Verse 3]
Under my thumb a Siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb she's the sweetest, hmmm, pet in the world

The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

[Instrumental Break]
Ah, take it easy babe

It's down to me, oh yeah
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Yeah, it feels alright

[Verse 4]
Under my thumb her eyes are just kept to herself
Under my thumb, well I, I can still look at someone else

[Chorus]
It's down to me, oh that's what I said
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Say it's all...
Say it's all...

Take it easy babe

Doncha Bother Me Lyrics","[Chorus]
I said, Oh no, don't you follow me no more
I said, Oh no, don't you follow me no more
Well, I'm looking for my face and I got no place to go

[Chorus]
I said, Oh no, don't you follow me no more
I said, Oh no, don't you follow me no more
Well, pick your own mind and don't you touch mine no more

[Verse 1]
Still waiting here for a single idea
In your clothes and your hair, I wore it last year
Oh no, don't you follow me no more

[Chorus]
I said, Oh no, don't you copy me no more
I said, Oh no, don't you copy me no more
Well, the lines around my eyes are protected by a copyright law

Well, all the clubs and the bars and the little red cars
Not knowing why, but trying to get high
Oh no, don;t you follow me no more

Don't you follow, don't you follow"

Flight 505 Lyrics","[Verse]
Well I was happy here at home, I've got everything I need
Happy being on my own, just living the life I lead
Well suddenly it dawned on me that this was not my life
So I just phoned the airline girl and said...

[Refrain]
Get me on flight number 505
Get me on flight number 505

[Verse 2]
Well I confirmed my reservation, then I hopped a cab
No idea of my destination and feeling pretty bad
With my suitcase in my hand and in my head my new life
So then I told the airline girl, Well...

[Refrain]
Get me on flight number 505
Get me on flight number 505

All right

[Verse 3]
Well I sat right there in my seat, well, feeling like a king
With the whole world right at my feet, Of course I'll have a drink
Well suddenly I saw that we never ever would arrive
He put the plane down in the sea

[Refrain]
The end of flight number 505
The end of flight number 505

All right

They put the plane down in the sea

[Refrain]
The end of flight number 505
The end of flight number 505"

High And Dry Lyrics","[Verse 1]
High and dry well, I'm up here with no warning
High and dry well, I couldn't get a word in
High and dry oh, what a way to go
She left me standing here just high and dry

[Verse 2]
A minute I was up there standing by her side
The next I was down there, well, left out of the ride
High and dry, oh what a way to go
She left me standing here just high and dry

[Verse 3]
Anything I wished for I only had to ask her - yes
I think she found out it was money I was after
High and dry, oh what a weird letdown
She left me standing here just high and dry

All right

[Verse 4]
Well, it's lucky that I didn't have any love towards her
Next time I'll make sure that the girl will be much poorer
High and dry, oh what a way to go
She left me standing here just high and dry

[Verse 5]
High and dry, well, I'm up here with no warning - yes
High and dry, well, I couldn't get a word in
High and dry, oh what a way to go
She left me standing here just high and dry

Well she left me standing here just high and dry
Well she left me standing here just high and dry"

You don't know what's going on
You've been away for far too long

The girl who wants to run away
Discovers that she's had her day

It's Not Easy Lyrics","[Intro]
It's not easy
It's not easy living on your own
It's not easy
It's not easy living on your own

[Chorus]
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's a pretty hard, baby (it's not easy)
It's not easy living on your own

[Verse 1]
All of the things that you used to do
If they're done now, well, they're done by you
It seems a big failing in a man
To take his girl for granted if he can

[Chorus]
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's a pretty hard, baby (it's not easy)
It's not easy living on your own

[Verse 2]
There's no place where you can call home
Got me running like a cat in a thunder storm
Just a big bed and a telephone
Like the last remnants of a stately home

[Chorus][x2]
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's a pretty hard, baby (it's not easy)
It's not easy living on your own

[Verse 3]
Sit here thinking with your head of fire
Go think the same thing and never tire
Imagining the glow of her long clean hair
As she goes to sit on her own high chair

[Chorus]
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's a pretty hard, baby (it's not easy)
It's not easy living on your own

[Outro]
It's not easy - a pretty tough thing
It's not easy - well, life's pretty rough
It's not easy - it's a hard time baby
It's not easy - it's a hard time baby
It's not easy - it's pretty hard..."

Think Lyrics","[Verse 1]

There no charge of any kind
Try a very simple test
You should just retrace your steps

How we lived I'll never know
Conning people for a dime

Still, I am the same old me
You say I lack maturity

We're not children anymore
We don't need to play with toys
Take a look and you will find

Paint It Black Lyrics","[Chorus]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Verse 1]
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

[Guitar solo]

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

[Bridge]
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

[Bridge]
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

[Chorus]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Outro]
I wanna see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah"
