Sympathy for the Devil Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 2]
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 3]
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

Oh yeah, get down heavy!
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Variation]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game

[Verse 4]
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

No Expectations Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Take me to the station
And put me on a train
I've got no expectations
To pass through here again

[Verse 2]
Once I was a rich man
Now I am so poor
But never in my sweet short life
Have I felt like this before

[Verse 3]
Your heart is like a diamond
You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind

[Verse 4]
Our love was like the water
That splashes on a stone
Our love is like our music
Its here, and then its gone

[Verse 5]
So take me to the airport
And put me on a plane
I got no expectations
To pass through here again"

Dear Doctor Lyrics","[Chorus]
Oh help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
There's a pain where there once was a heart
It's sleeping, it's a beating
Can't you please tear it out, and preserve it
Right there in that jar?

[Verse 1]
Oh help me, please mama, I'm sickening
It's today that's the day of the plunge
Oh the gal I'm to marry
Is a bow-legged sow
I've been soaking up drink like a sponge
Don't you worry, get dressed, cried my mother
As she plied me with bourbon so sour
Pull your socks up, put your suit on
Comb your long hair down
For you will be wed in the hour

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 2]
I was trembling, as I put on my jacket
It had creases as sharp as a knife
I put the ring in my pocket
But there was a note
And my heart it jumped into my mouth
It read, Darling, I'm sorry to hurt you
But I have no courage to speak to your face
But I'm down in Virginia with your cousin Lou
There be no wedding today

[Chorus]
So help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
You can put back my heart in its hole
Oh mama, I'm crying
Tears of relief
And my pulse is now under control"
"
Parachute Woman Lyrics","[Chorus]
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
Parachute woman, land on me tonight

[Verse 1]
I'll break big in New Orleans
And I'll overspill in Caroline

[Chorus]
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
Parachute woman, join me for a ride

[Verse 2]
I'll make my play in Dallas
And get hot again in half the time

[Chorus]
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?

[Verse 3]
Well, my heavy throbbers itching
Just to lay a solid rhythm down"
"
Jig-Saw Puzzle Lyrics","[Verse 1]
There's a tramp sitting on my doorstep
Trying to waste his time
With his mentholated sandwich
He's a walking clothesline
And here comes the bishop's daughter
On the other side
She looks a trifle jealous
She has been an outcast all her life

[Chorus]
Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do my jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore

[Verse 2]
Oh the gangster looks so frightening
With his luger in his hand
When he gets home to his children
He's a family man
But when it comes to the nitty-gritty
He can shove in his knife
Yes he really looks quite religious
He has been an outlaw all his life

Chorus [x2]

[Verse 3]
Oh the singer, he looks angry
At being thrown to the lions
And the bass player, he looks nervous
About the girls outside
And the drummer, he's so shattered
Trying to keep up time
And the guitar players look damaged
They have been outcasts all their lives

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Oh, there's twenty-thousand grandmas
Wave their hankies in the air
All burning up their pensions
And shouting, It's not fair!
There's a regiment of soldiers
Standing looking on
And the queen is bravely shouting
What the hell is going on?
With a blood-curdling tally-ho
She charged into the ranks
And blessed all those grandmas who
With their dying breaths screamed, Thanks!

[Chorus]"
"
Street Fighting Man Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy
Because summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street boy
But what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band

[Chorus]
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!

[Verse 2]
Hey! Think the time is right for a Palace Revolution
But where I live the game to play is Compromise Solution!
Well then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band

[Chorus]
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!

[Verse 3]
Hey! Said my name is called Disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the King I'll rail at all his servants
Well then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band

[Chorus]
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!"
"
Prodigal Son Lyrics","[Verse]
Well a poor boy took his father's bread and started down the road
Started down the road
Took all he had and started down the road
Going out in this world, where God only knows
And that'll be the way to get along
Well poor boy spent all he had, famine come in the land
Famine come in the land
Spent all he had and famine come in the land
Said, ""I believe I'll go and hire me to some man""
And that'll be the way I'll get along
Well, man said, ""I'll give you a job for to feed my swine
For to feed my swine
I'll give you a job for to feed my swine""
Boy stood there and hung his head and cried
Because that is no way to get along
Said, ""I believe I'll ride, believe I'll go back home
Believe I'll go back home
Believe I'll ride, believe I'll go back home
Or down the road as far as I can go""
And that'll be the way to get along
Well, father said, ""See my son coming after me
Coming home to me""
Father ran and fell down on his knees
Said, Sing and praise, Lord have mercy on me
Mercy
Oh poor boy stood there, hung his head and cried
Hung his head and cried
Poor boy stood and hung his head and cried
Said, Father will you look on me as a child?
Yeah
Well father said, ""Eldest son, kill the fatted calf
Call the family round
Kill that calf and call the family round
My son was lost but now he is found
Because that's the way for us to get along""
Hey"

Stray Cat Blues Lyrics","[Intro]
Ah... hey
Yeah, cat's own tail

[Verse 1]
I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
I know you're no scared-eyed honey
There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs

[Refrain]
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Verse 2]
I can see that you're fifteen years old
No I don't want your I.D
And I can see that you're so far from home

[Refrain]
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet, bet your mama don't know you scream like that
I bet your mother don't know you can spit like that

[Verse 3]
You look so weird and you're so far from home
Bet you really miss your mother
Don't look so scared I'm no mad-brained bear

[Refrain]
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Woo!
I bet your mama don't know that you scratch like that
I bet she don't know you can bite like that

[Verse 4]
You say you got a friend, that she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs?
If she's so wild then she can join in too

[Refrain]
It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet you mama don't know you can bite like that
I'll bet she never saw you scratch my back"

Factory Girl Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Waiting for a girl who's got curlers in her hair
Waiting for a girl she has no money anywhere
We get buses everywhere

[Chorus]
Waiting for a factory girl

[Verse 2]
Waiting for a girl and her knees are much too fat
Waiting for a girl who wears scarves instead of hats
Her zipper's broken down the back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Waiting for a girl and she gets me into fights
Waiting for a girl we get drunk on Friday night
She's a sight for sore eyes

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Waiting for a girl and she's got stains all down her dress
Waiting for a girl and my feet are getting wet
She ain't come out yet

[Chorus]"

Salt Of The Earth Lyrics","[Chorus 1 -- Keith Richards]
Let’s drink to the hard working people
Lets drink to the lowly of birth
Raise your glass to the good and the evil
Lets drink to the salt of the earth

[Verse 1]
Say a prayer for the common foot soldier
Spare a thought for his back breaking work
Say a prayer for his wife and his children
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth

[Chorus 2]
And when I search a faceless crowd
A swirling mass of Gray and
Black and white
They don't look real to me
In fact, they look so strange

[Chorus 1]
Raise your glass to the hard working people
Lets drink to the uncounted heads
Lets think of the wavering millions
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead

[Verse 2]
Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
And a parade of the Gray suited grafters
A choice of cancer or polio

[Chorus 2]
And when I look in the faceless crowd
A swirling mass of grays and
Black and white
They don't look real to me
Or don't they look so strange

[Chorus 1]
Let’s drink to the hard working people
Lets think of the lowly of birth
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people
Lets drink to the salt of the earth

[Chorus 1]
Lets drink to the hard working people
Lets drink to the salt of the earth
Lets drink to the two thousand million
Lets think of the humble of birth"
