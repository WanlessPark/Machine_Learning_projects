Come Together Lyrics","[Intro: John Lennon]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Here come old flat-top, he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, ""I know you, you know me""
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Shoot me, shoot me
Right!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
He roller-coaster, he got early warnin'
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, ""One and one and one is three""
Got to be good-lookin' 'cause he's so hard to see

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me
Ugh!

[Outro: John Lennon]
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
[Fade-out]
Come together, yeah
Come together..."

Something Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how"

Maxwell's Silver Hammer Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
""Can I take you out to the pictures
Joa, oa, oa, oan?""
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times ""I must not be
So, o, o, o""
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 3]
P. C. 31 said, ""We caught a dirty one.""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure he was dead"

Oh! Darling Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I’ll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I’ll never do you no harm

[Verse 2]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I’ll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don’t ever leave me alone

[Chorus]
When you told me you didn’t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn’t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly fell down and died

[Verse 3]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I’ll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I’ll never do you no harm

I’ll never let you down
(Oh! Believe me darling)
Believe me when I tell you

Octopus's Garden Lyrics","[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 1]
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 3]
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe
We would be so happy, you and me
No-one there to tell us what to do

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you"

Here Comes the Sun Lyrics","[Intro]
Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

Because the wind is high it blows my mind

You Never Give Me Your Money Lyrics","[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any job, I got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go

[Verse 4]
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true...today
Came true...today
Came true... today...yes it did
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven"

"
Mean Mr. Mustard Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

[Verse 2]
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man"
"
Polythene Pam Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
That makes ""The News of the World""
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
G'day!"
"
She Came in Through the Bathroom Window Lyrics","[Intro]
Oh, listen to that now, eheheh
Oh look out! It's-

[Verse 1]
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

[Verse 2]
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah"
"
Golden Slumbers Lyrics","[Chorus]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby"
"
Carry That Weight Lyrics","[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

The End Lyrics","[Verse 1]

Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

Her Majesty Lyrics","[Verse]
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah
Someday I'm going to make her mine"
