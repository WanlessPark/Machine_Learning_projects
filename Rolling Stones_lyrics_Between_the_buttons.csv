Let's Spend the Night Together Lyrics","[Intro]
My-My-My-My

[Verse 1]
Don't you worry about what's on your mind, oh my
I'm in no hurry I can take my time, oh my
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tied (tongue's getting tied)
I'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm high, but I try, try, try, oh my

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
My-my-my-my, oh my

[Verse 2]
I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
(Let's spend the night together)
But I just can't apologize, oh no
(Let's spend the night together)
Don't hang me up and don't let me down (don't let me down)
We could have fun just groovin' around around and 'round and
Oh my, my

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together

[Interlude]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever

[Bridge]
You know I'm smiling, baby
You need some guiding, baby
I'm just deciding, baby; now
I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Let's spend the night together now
Oh m-my-my-my-my-my-my

[Verse 3]
This doesn't happen to me every day, oh my
(Let's spend the night together)
No excuses offered anyway, oh my
(Let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need (your every need)
And now I know you will satisfy me
Oh m-my-my-my-my-my

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Outro]
Oh m-my-my-my-my-my-my
(Let's spend the night together)
Now I need you, need you more than ever, woman
(Let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need, woman
(Let's spend the night together)
Now I know, I know you'll satisfy me, whoa, my-my
(Let's spend the night together)
I beg you, baby, oh my-my-my-my-my-my
(Let's spend the night together)
A-come on, now, oh baby, my-my-my-my
(Let's spend the night together)"

Yesterday's Papers Lyrics","[Chorus]
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world

[Verse 1]
Well, after this time I finally learned
After the pain and hurt
After all this, what have I achieved?
I've realized it's time to leave

[Chorus]
'Cause who wants yesterday's papers?
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world

[Verse 2]
I'm living a life of constant change
Every day means the turn of a page
Yesterday's papers are such bad news
Same thing applies to me and you

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world

[Verse 3]
It seems very hard to have just one girl
When there's a million in the world
All of these people just can't wait
To fall right into their big mistake

[Chorus]
'Cause who wants yesterday's papers?
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world"

Ruby Tuesday Lyrics","[Verse 1]
She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

[Verse 2]
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

[Verse 3]
""There's no time to lose,"" I heard her say
""Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you
Will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?""

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you"

Connection Lyrics","[Chorus]
All I want to do is to get back to you
Connection, I just can't make no connection
But all I want to do is to get back to you

[Verse 1]
Everything is going in the wrong direction
The doctor wants to give me more injections
Giving me shots for a thousand rare infections
And I don't know if he'll let me go

[Chorus]
Connection, I just can't make no connection
But all I want to do is to get back to you
Connection, I just can't make it, connection
All I want to do is to get back to you

[Verse 2]
My bags, they get a very close inspection
I wonder why it is that they suspect them
They're dying to add me to their collection
And I don't know if they'll let me go

[Chorus]
Connection, I just can't make no connection
But all I want to do is to get back to you
Connection, I just can't make no connection
And all I want to do is to get back to you
Connection, I just can't make no connection
All I want to do is to get back to you"

She Smiled Sweetly Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Why do my thoughts loom so large on me?
They seem to stay, for day after day
And won't disappear, I've tried every way

[Chorus]
But she smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
And says don't worry
Oh, no no no

[Verse 2]
Where does she hide it inside of her?
That keeps her peace most every day
And won't disappear, my hair's turning grey

[Chorus]
But she smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
And says don't worry

[Bridge]
""There's nothing in why or when
There's no use trying, you're here digging again
And over again""

[Verse 3]
That's what she said so softly
I understood for once in my life
And feeling good most all of the time

[Chorus]
'Cause she smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
And said don't worry
Oh, no no no
Oh, no no no
Oh, no no no"

Cool, Calm and Collected Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well, she's very wealthy, it's true
So in that, she is one up on you
She's dressed all in red, white and blue
And she always knows more than you do

[Chorus]
She's so affected
Cool, calm, collected

[Verse 2]
She knows who to smile to today
She has just been brought up in that way
She knows all the right games to play
And she always just knows what to say

[Chorus]
She's well-respected
Cool, calm, collected

[Kazoo solo]

[Chorus]
She's so affected
Cool, calm, collected

[Verse 3]
In public, the strain's hard to bear
She exudes such a confident air
But behind, she is not without care
But she sweeps it right under her hair

[Chorus]
She's well-respected
Cool, calm, collected

[Verse 4]
She seems to glow brilliantly white
And her hair seems to shine in the night
With her feet unbelievably light
And her teeth ready, sharpened to bite

[Chorus]
She's so respected
Cool, calm, collected"

All Sold Out Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Why put this sadness inside of me?
Why be so matter-of-fact?
Why put this one bit of hope in me?
You sold me out, and that's that

[Verse 2]
I hope that you're having fun with me
There's not much left to attack
I hope that you're nearly done with me
You sold me out, and that's that

[Chorus]
All sold out, I’d never seen
A mind so tangled, a girl so strangled
All sold out, well, I felt so green
It was just like that, I was put down flat
I was sold out just like that

[Bridge]
Oh, baby
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, that's that

[Chorus]
All sold out, I’d never seen
A mind so tangled, a girl so strangled
All sold out, well, I felt so green
It was just like that, I was put down flat
I was sold out just like that

[Verse 3]
I missed the point of you doing it
Your mind has just jumped the track
I took a bit different view of it
You sold me out, and that's that

[Outro]
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
That's that"
"
My Obsession Lyrics","[Chorus]
My obsessions are your possessions
Every piece that I can get
My obsessions are your possessions
'Til my mouth is soaking wet
I think I blew it now, confession

[Verse 1]
You can't dodge it, it's simple logic
You'd be better off with me
And you'll know it when you lost it
Know it

[Chorus]
My obsessions are your possessions
Are you smiling on my way
My obsessions are your possessions
One that you should give away
Give it to me now, I've no objection

[Verse 2]
I don't mind if it's unkind
And it's not my property
But I want it just to be mine
Exclusively

[Bridge]
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby, aah

[Verse 3]
You need teaching, you're a girl
There are things in this world
That need teaching with discretion
My profession

[Chorus]
My obsessions are your possessions
Are you used to the idea?
My obsessions are your possessions
Do you feel at home right here?
You should relax, it's my impression

[Verse 4]
Didn't see you were so young
I could almost be your son
Please turn in my direction
No objection"

Who's Been Sleeping Here? Lyrics","[Verse 1]
What you say, girl?
You see, what is wrong?
You must be joking
You was led along

[Chorus]
But the butler, the baker
The laughing cavalier
Will tell me now
Who's been sleeping here

I want to know
Tell me, baby, who's been sleeping...

[Verse 2]
What you say, girl?
Who'd you see that night?
I, I was doing
Doing something right

[Chorus]
Oh the soldier, the sailor
And then there's the three musketeers
Yes, they'll tell me now
Who's been sleeping here

Did I ever tell you I want to know?
Hey baby, who's been sleeping...

[Verse 3]
Don't you look like
Like a Goldilocks?
There must be somewhere
Somewhere you can stop

[Chorus]
Yes, there's the noseless old newsboy
The old British brigadier
But he'll tell me now
Who's been sleeping here

[Verse 4]
Who's been eating
Eating off my plate?
Who will tell me?
Who'll investigate?

[Chorus]
There's the sergeants, the soldiers
The cruel old grenadier
But they'll tell me now
Who's been sleeping here

[Outro]
Cause I want to know
Who's been sleeping right here
Was it your mummy, your daddy?
Who's been sleeping here?
Was it your auntie, your uncle?
Who's been sleeping here?
Was it your boyfriend, your girlfriend?
Who's been sleeping here?
All right
Who's been sleeping here?"

Complicated Lyrics","[Verse 1]
She looks so simple in her way
Does the same thing everyday
But she's dedicated to having her own way
She's very complicated

[Verse 2]
Women seem to fill her mind
And many men in so short time
But she's underrated, she treats me oh so kind
She's very complicated
Yeah!

[Verse 3]
We talk together and discuss
What is really best for us
She's sophisticated, my head's fit to bust
Cause she's so complicated
Break!

[Bridge]
Yeah!

[Verse 4]
She knows just how to please her man
She's softer than a baby lamb
But she's educated, doesn't give a damn
She's very complicated
Break!

[Bridge]
Na na na na na
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
She looks so simple in her way
Does the same thing everyday
But she's dedicated to having her own way
She's very complicated
Break!

[Outro]
Break!
Na na come on, baby!
Na na na na na
Na na na na, yeah
A-come on, baby
Uh! Come on, babe"

Miss Amanda Jones Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Down and down she goes
Our Amanda Jones
I said down and down and down and down
She'd look really lovely at home
'Til somebody going to come up and ask her
To live happily ever after, Miss Amanda Jones

[Verse 2]
On and on she goes
Little Miss Amanda Jones
I said on and on and on and on
Just watch her as she grows
Don't want to say it very obviously
But she's losing her nobility, Miss Amanda Jones

[Chorus]
Hey girl, don't you realize
The money invested in you?
Hey girl, you've just got to find
Someone who'll really pull your family through

[Verse 3]
Up and up she goes
Our Amanda Jones
I said up and up and up and up
She looks quite delightfully stoned
She's the darling of the discotheque crowd
Of her lineage she's rightfully proud, Miss Amanda Jones

[Chorus]
Hey girl, with your nonsense nose
Pointing right down at the floor
Hey girl, your suspender shows
And the girl behind you looks a bit unsure

[Verse 4]
Round and round she goes
The world of Amanda Jones
I said round and round and round and round
The balls and the dinners and shows
The little girl, she just wanders about
'Til it's time for her coming out, Miss Amanda Jones

[Outro]
Round and round and round...."

Something Happened to Me Yesterday Lyrics","[Verse 1: Mick Jagger]
Something happened to me yesterday
Something I can't speak of right away
Something happened to me
Something oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday

[Chorus 1: Keith Richards]
He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law
Something

[Verse 2: Mick]
Something very strange I hear you say
You're talking in a most peculiar way
But something really threw me
Something oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday (yesterday...)

[Chorus 2: Keith]
He don't know just where it's gone
He don't really care at all
No one's sure just what it was
Or the meaning and the cause
Something

What kind of joint is this?
Take your partners

[Chorus 1: Keith]
He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law
Something

[Verse 3: Mick]
Someone says there's something more to pay
For sins that you committed yesterday
It's really rather drippy
But something oh, so trippy
Something happened to me yesterday (right!)

[Chorus 2: Keith]
He don't know just where it's gone
He don't really care at all
No one's sure just what it was
Or the meaning and the cause
Something

[Verse 4: Mick]
Someone's singing loud across the bay
Sitting on a mat about to pray
Isn't half as loony
As something oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday (right!)

[Chorus 1: Keith]
He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law
Something

[Outro]
Well, thank you very much
And now I think it's time for us all to go
So from all of us to all of you
Not forgetting the boys in the band
And our producer, Reg Thorpe
We'd like to say, God Bless
So, if you're out tonight, don't forget
If you're on your bike, wear white
Evening, all"
