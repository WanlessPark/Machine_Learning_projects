Around and Around Lyrics","[Chorus]
I said the joint was rocking
Uh, going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well it sounds so sweet
I had to take me a chance
Rose out of my seat
I just had to dance
Started moving my feet
Whoa to clapping my hands

[Chorus]
I said the joint was a rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Yeah at twelve o'clock
Yeah, the place was packed
Front doors was locked
Yeah the place was packed
And when the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But they kept on rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound

[Chorus]
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
And they go on rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

Well the joint stayed a rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

Confessin' The Blues Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Baby, here I stand before you
With my heart in my hand
I put it to you mama
Hoping that you'll understand
Oh, baby

Mama, please don't dog me around
Yeah I, I would rather love you, baby
Than anyone else I know in town

This is my confession, mama
And it's sung by all your song
It proves that I'm in heaven, mama
When you hold me in your arms

Well, baby
Can I have you for myself
Yeah, if I can't have you, baby
I don't want nobody else

[Instrumental]

Well, baby
Don't you want a man like me
Well, baby
Don't you want a man like me
Yeah, think about your future, baby
Forget about your used to be"

Empty Heart Lyrics","[Verse 1]
An empty heart is like an empty life
I said an empty heart is like an empty life
Well, it makes you feel like you want to cry
Like you want to cry
Well you've been my lover for a long long time[x2]
Well you left me all alone, and end my time
I want my lover again[x2]
I want it back again
Yeah, a little stick
Yeah, a little bit darling
Take it down
Yeah, take it down
Come on back to me, baby[x2]
Come on
Come on back to me
And I'll show you I'll show you
That a empty heart means a empty life
Yeah an empty heart like a empty life
Oh, it makes you feel like you want to die
Like you want to die
Like you want to die
(I want to die)"

Time Is on My Side Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is
Now you always say
That you want to be free

[Chorus]
But you'll come running back (said you would baby)
You'll come running back (I said so many times before)
You'll come running back to me
Oh, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is
You're searching for good times

[Chorus]
But just wait and see
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more)
You'll come running back (spend the rest of my life with you, baby)
You'll come running back to me
Go ahead, go ahead and light up the town

[Verse 2]
And baby, do everything your heart desires
Remember, I'll always be around
And I know, I know
Like I told you so many times before
You're going to come back, baby
Because I know
You're going to come back knocking
Yeah, knocking right on my door
Yes, yes!
Well, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is
Cause I got the real love
The kind that you need

You'll come running back (said you would, baby)
You'll come running back (I don't always said you would)
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more)

Yes time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Oh, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is

Oh, time, time, time is on my side
Yeah, time, time, time is on my side"

Good Times, Bad Times Lyrics","There've been good times
There've been bad times
I have my share of hard times too
But I lost my faith in the world
Honey, when I lost you

Remember the good times
We've had together?
Don't you want them back again?
Though these hard times are bugging me now
Honey now it's a sin

There's gotta be trust in this world
Or it won't get very far
Well, trust in someone
Or there's gonna be war"
"
It's All Over Now Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

[Chorus][x2]
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

[Verse 2]
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Well, I used to walk in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

[Chorus][x4]"

Under the Boardwalk Lyrics","[Verse 1]
When the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby

[Chorus]
Is where I'll be
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We were falling in love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)

[Verse 2]
On the park you'll hear
The happy sound of a carousel
You can almost taste the hot dogs
And french fries they sell
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby

[Chorus]
Is where I'll be
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We were falling in love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)
Oh, under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby

[Chorus]"

Congratulations Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Congratulations
Congratulations
Well done, my friend
You've done it again
You've gone and broken another heart
Yeah, you've torn it apart
You've done it before
Hope to do it some more
You've got it down to a fine art
Remember the first time
You tried to do it to me
My girl won't fall
Just wait and see
Just wait and see
Congratulations
Congratulations
You've gone and broken another heart
Yeah, you've torn it apart
La la, la la la, la la la la (congratulations)"

Grown Up Wrong Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well, you've grown up all wrong, well you've grown up all wrong
You come on too strong, well you've grown up all wrong
Well, you were easy to fool when you were in school
But you've grown up all wrong

[Guitar solo]

Well, you've grown up on me, well you've grown up on me
Don't believe what I see, well you've grown up on me
Well, you look so sweet when you're in your jeans
But you've grown up on me, raise your hands

[Guitar solo]

Well, you've grown up too fast, well you've grown up too fast
Don't forget about the past, girl you've grown up too fast
Well you won't be a fool but I'm through with you
Well, you've grown up too fast, well you've grown up too fast"

If You Need Me Lyrics","[Verse 1]
If you need me
Why don't you call me
Said if you need me
Why don't you call me
Don't wait too long
When things go wrong
I'll be there, yeah
Where I belong
Said if you want me
Why don't you send for me
Said if you want, want, want
All you got to do is send for me
Don't wait to long
Just a pick up your phone
I'll be there
Right there, where I belong
People always told me, darling
That you didn't mean me no good
But I know deep down in my heart
I done the best I could
And one of these days, darling
It won't be long
You're going to come walking through that door
And I know in my mind these are the very
Words you're going to say to me
I still love you
Always thinking of you
I still love, love, love
Always thinking of you
Don't wait too long
When things go wrong
I'll be there, right there
Where I belong"
