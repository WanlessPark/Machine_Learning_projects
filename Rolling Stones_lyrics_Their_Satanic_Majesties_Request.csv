Sing This All Together Lyrics","Why don't we sing this song all together
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from
Pictures of us through the steamy haze
Pictures of us painted in our place

Why don't we sing this song all together
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from

Why don't we sing this song all together
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from
Pictures of us beating on our drum
Never stopping until the rain has come

Why don't we sing this song all together
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from"

Citadel Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Men in arms shout who goes there
We have journeyed far from here
Armed with bibles make us swear

[Chorus]
Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

[Verse 2]
Flags are flying, dollar bills
Round the heights of concrete hills
You can see the pinnacles

[Chorus]
Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

[Verse 3]
In the streets are many walls
Hear the peasants come and crawl
You can hear their numbers called

[Chorus]
Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

[Verse 4]
Screaming people fly so fast
In their shiny metal cars
Through the woods of steel and glass

[Chorus]
Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel
Oh well!"
"
In Another Land Lyrics","[Verse 1]
In another land where the breeze and the
Trees and flowers were blue
I stood and held your hand
And the grass grew high and the feathers floated by
I stood and held your hand

[Chorus]
And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else will do
Then I awoke
Was this some kind of joke?
Much to my surprise
I opened my eyes

[Verse 2]
We walked across the sand and the sea and
The sky and the castles were blue
I stood and held your hand
And the spray flew high and the feathers floated by
I stood and held your hand

[Chorus]
And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else will do
Then I awoke
Was this some kind of joke?
Much to my surprise
I opened my eyes

[Verse 3]
We heard the trumpets blow and the sky
Turned red when I accidently said
That I didn't know how I came to be here
Not fast asleep in bed
I stood and held your hand

[Chorus]
And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else's hand
Then I awoke
Was this some kind of joke?
I opened my eyes
Much to my surprise

[Outro]"

2000 Man Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well, my name is a number
A piece of plastic film
And I'm growing funny flowers
In my little window sill
Don’t you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
Well my wife still respects me
I really misused her
I am having an affair
With the Random computer
Don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all

[Chorus]
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy. proud of your sun

[Verse 2]
Oh daddy, your brain's still flashing
Like it did when you were young
Or do you come down crashing
Seeing all the things you'd done
All was a big put on

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
And you know who's the 2000 man
And your kids they just won't understand you at all"

Sing This All Together (See What Happens) Lyrics","[Verse]
Why don't we sing this song all together
Open our minds let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from
Pictures of us in the circling sun
Pictures of the show that we're all one"

She's a Rainbow Lyrics","{​Instrumental Hook}​

[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere;
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere;
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

{​Instrumental}​

[Verse 1]
Have you seen her dressed in blue
See the sky in front of you
And her face is like a sail
Speck of white so fair and pale
Have you seen the lady fairer

[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere;
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

[Verse 2]
Have you seen her all in gold
Like a queen in days of old
She shoots colours all around
Like a sunset going down
Have you seen the lady fairer

[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere;
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

{​Instrumental}​

[Outro]
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours"

The Lantern Lyrics","[Verse]
We, on our present life
Knew that the stars were right
That if you are the first to go
You'll leave a sign to let me know
Tell me so
Please, carry the Lantern lights
You crossed the sea of night
Free from the spell of fright
Your cloak it is a spirit shroud
You'll wake me in my sleeping hours
Like a cloud
So, please, carry the Lantern high
Me, in my sorry plight
You waiting every night
My face it turns a deathly pale
You're talking to me, through your veil
I hear you wail
So, please carry the Lantern light
The servants sleep
The door's are barred
You hear the stopping of my heart-we never part
So, please carry the Lantern high"
"
Gomper Lyrics","[Verse]
By the lake with lilly flowers
Wallow away the evening hours
To and fro she's gently gliding
On the glassy lake she's riding
She swims to the side
The sun sees her dried
The birds hover high
I'd stifle a cry
The birds hover high
She moans with a sigh"
"
2000 Light Years From Home Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Sun turnin' 'round with graceful motion
We're setting off with soft explosion
Bound for a star with fiery oceans
It's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home
Freezing red deserts turn to dark
Energy here in every part
It's so very lonely, you're six hundred light years from home

[Chorus]
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home

[Verse 2]
Bell flight fourteen you now can land
See you on Aldebaran, safe on the green desert sand
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home"

On with the show Lyrics","[Verse]
Good evening one and all, we're all so glad to see you here
We'll play your favourite songs while you all soak up the atmosphere
We'll start with 'Old Man River', then maybe 'Stormy Weather', too
I'm sure you know just what to do
On with the show good health to you
Please pour another glass, it's time to watch the cabaret
Your wife will never know that you're not really working late
Your hostess here is Wendy, you'll find her very friendly, too
And we don't care just what you do
On with the show good health to you
Petina, start the show at 2 o'clock
Oh, if by chance you find that you can't make it anymore
We'll put you in a cab and get you safely to the door
But we've got all the answers and we've got lovely dancers, too
There's nothing else you have to do
On with the show good health to you
You're all such lovely people dancing, eating 'round the floor
But if you have to fight, please take your trouble out the door
For now I say with sorrow until this time tomorrow
We'll bid you all a fond adieu
On with the show good health to you"
