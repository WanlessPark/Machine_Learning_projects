Around and Around Lyrics","[Chorus]
I said the joint was rocking
Uh, going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well it sounds so sweet
I had to take me a chance
Rose out of my seat
I just had to dance
Started moving my feet
Whoa to clapping my hands

[Chorus]
I said the joint was a rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Yeah at twelve o'clock
Yeah, the place was packed
Front doors was locked
Yeah the place was packed
And when the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But they kept on rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound

[Chorus]
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
And they go on rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

Well the joint stayed a rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

Good Times, Bad Times Lyrics","There've been good times
There've been bad times
I have my share of hard times too
But I lost my faith in the world
Honey, when I lost you

Remember the good times
We've had together?
Don't you want them back again?
Though these hard times are bugging me now
Honey now it's a sin

There's gotta be trust in this world
Or it won't get very far
Well, trust in someone
Or there's gonna be war"

It's All Over Now Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

[Chorus][x2]
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

[Verse 2]
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Well, I used to walk in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

[Chorus][x4]"

Empty Heart Lyrics","[Verse 1]
An empty heart is like an empty life
I said an empty heart is like an empty life
Well, it makes you feel like you want to cry
Like you want to cry
Well you've been my lover for a long long time[x2]
Well you left me all alone, and end my time
I want my lover again[x2]
I want it back again
Yeah, a little stick
Yeah, a little bit darling
Take it down
Yeah, take it down
Come on back to me, baby[x2]
Come on
Come on back to me
And I'll show you I'll show you
That a empty heart means a empty life
Yeah an empty heart like a empty life
Oh, it makes you feel like you want to die
Like you want to die
Like you want to die
(I want to die)"

Confessin' The Blues Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Baby, here I stand before you
With my heart in my hand
I put it to you mama
Hoping that you'll understand
Oh, baby

Mama, please don't dog me around
Yeah I, I would rather love you, baby
Than anyone else I know in town

This is my confession, mama
And it's sung by all your song
It proves that I'm in heaven, mama
When you hold me in your arms

Well, baby
Can I have you for myself
Yeah, if I can't have you, baby
I don't want nobody else

[Instrumental]

Well, baby
Don't you want a man like me
Well, baby
Don't you want a man like me
Yeah, think about your future, baby
Forget about your used to be"

Not Fade Away Lyrics","[Chorus]
I'm going to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I'm going to love you night and day
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away

[Verse]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show it and you're driving me back
Your love for me has got to be real
For you to know just how I feel
Love is real and not fade away
Well love is real and not fade away

[Chorus]
I'm going to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I'm going to love you night and day
Well love is love and not fade away

Bye Bye Johnny Lyrics","Well she drew out all her money out from southern trust
And put a little boy aboard a greyhound bus
Leaving Lousiana for the golden west
Down came her tears from her happiness
Her own little son named Johnny B Goode
Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood

Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode

Well she remember taking money out from gathering crops
And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop
As long as he could play it by the railroad side
And wouldn't get in trouble she'd be satisfied
Never thought there'd ever come a day like this
When she would gladly give her son a goodbye kiss

Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode

Well she finally got the letter she was dreaming of
Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love
As soon as he was married he would bring her back
And build a mansion for her by the railroad tracks
And everytime they heard the locomotive roar
They'd be a standing, waving in the kitchen door

Howling bye bye bye bye
Now bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode"

You Better Move On Lyrics","[Verse 1]
You ask me to give up the hand of the girl I love
You tell me, I'm not the man she's worthy of
But who are you to tell her who to love?
That's up to her, yes, and the Lord above
You better move on

[Verse 2]
Well, I know you can buy her fancy clothes and diamond rings
But I believe she's happy with me, without those things
Still you beg me to set her free
But, my friend, that will never be
You better move on

[Bridge]
Now I don't blame you for loving her
But can't you understand, man, she's my girl
And I, I'm never never ever gonna let her go
Because I, yeah, I love her so

[Verse 3]
I think you better go now, I'm getting mighty mad
You ask me to give up the only love I've ever had
Maybe I would, oh, but I love her so
I'm never gonna let her go
You better move on

[Outro]
You better move on[x3]"

If You Need Me Lyrics","[Verse 1]
If you need me
Why don't you call me
Said if you need me
Why don't you call me
Don't wait too long
When things go wrong
I'll be there, yeah
Where I belong
Said if you want me
Why don't you send for me
Said if you want, want, want
All you got to do is send for me
Don't wait to long
Just a pick up your phone
I'll be there
Right there, where I belong
People always told me, darling
That you didn't mean me no good
But I know deep down in my heart
I done the best I could
And one of these days, darling
It won't be long
You're going to come walking through that door
And I know in my mind these are the very
Words you're going to say to me
I still love you
Always thinking of you
I still love, love, love
Always thinking of you
Don't wait too long
When things go wrong
I'll be there, right there
Where I belong"

Poison Ivy Lyrics","She comes on like a rose
And everybody knows
She'll get you in dutch
You can look but you'd better not touch

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around

She's pretty as a daisy
But look out man she's crazy
She'll really do you in
If you let her get under your skin

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around

Measles make you bumpy and mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold'll cool you but whooping cough'll fool you
But poison ivy's gonna make you itch

You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around

Measles make you bumpy and mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold'll cool you and whooping cough'll fool you
But poison ivy's gonna make you itch

You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around

La la la la
La la la la"
