Ruby Tuesday Lyrics","[Verse 1]
She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

[Verse 2]
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

[Verse 3]
""There's no time to lose,"" I heard her say
""Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you
Will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?""

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you"

Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? Lyrics","[Chorus]
Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Have you had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

[Verse 1]
I'm glad I opened your eyes
The have-nots would have tried to freeze you in ice

[Chorus]
Have you seen your brother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Have you had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

[Verse 2]
Well, I was just passing the time
I'm all alone, won't you give all your sympathy to mine?

[Bridge]
Tell me a story about how you adore me
Live in the shadow, see through the shadow
Glimpse through the shadow, tear at the shadow
Hate in the shadow, and love in your shadowy life

[Chorus]
Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Has he had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

[Verse 3]
Just where have you been all your life?
Talking about all the people who would try anything twice

[Chorus]
Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Has she had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

[Verse 4]
Well, you take your choice at the time
The brave old world or the slide to the depths of decline"

Don't you worry about what's on your mind, oh my
I'm in no hurry I can take my time, oh my

Lady Jane Lyrics","[Verse 1]
My sweet Lady Jane, when I see you again
Your servant am I and will humbly remain
Just heed this plea, my love
On bended knees, my love
I pledge myself to lady Jane

My dear lady Anne, I've done what I can
I must take my leave for promised I am
This play is run, my love
Your time has come, my love
I pledge my troth to lady Jane

Oh my sweet Marie, I wait at your eaves
The sands have run out for your lady and me
When luck is nigh, my love
Her station's right, my love
Life is secure with lady Jane"

Out of Time Lyrics","[Verse 1]
You don't know what's going on
You've been away for far too long
You can't come back and think you are still mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

[Chorus]
Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
You are all left out
Out of there without a doubt

The girl who wants to run away
Discovers that she's had her day
It's no good your thinking that you are still mine

I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

You thought you were a clever girl
Giving up your social whirl
But you can't come back and be the first in line, oh no

My Girl Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I got sunshine, on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I got the month of May
I guess, you'll say
What can make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
My girl (my girl) my girl
Talking about my girl

[Verse 2]
I go so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song, baby, than the birds in the trees
I guess, you'll say
What can make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
My girl (my girl) my girl
Talking about my girl

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
I don't need no money, or count my pay
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can take
I guess, you'll say
What can make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
My girl (my girl) my girl
Talking about my girl

[Verse 4]
I got sunshine, on a cloudy day
I even got the month of May
(My girl) My girl
I'm talking about my girl"

Back Street Girl Lyrics","[Verse]
I don't want you to be high
I don't want you to be down
Don't want to tell you no lie
Just want you to be around
Please come right up to my ears
You will be able to hear what I say
Don't want you out in my world
Just you be my backstreet girl
Please don't be part of my life
Please keep yourself to yourself
Please don't you bother my wife
That way you won't get no help
Don't try to ride on my horse
You're rather common and coarse anyway
Don't want you out in my world
Just you be my backstreet girl
Please don't you call me at home
Please don't come knocking at night
Please never ring on the phone
Your manners are never quite right
Please take the favors I grant
Curtsy and look nonchalant, just for me
Don't want you part of my world
Just you be my backstreet girl"

Please Go Home Lyrics","[Intro]
Please go home[x2]

[Verse]
Well maybe I'm talking to fast
But I won't be the first or the last
In the sea of the thousand you cast
Come on please go home
I don't have to ask what you do
I just have to look to get you
Means nothing to me to get through
Please go home
I don't want to be on my own
Because I can't talk much better alone
But I don't have to ring like a phone
Won't you please go home
Please go home
In some early part of your days
You were told of the devious ways
That you thought you could get without pay
Won't you please go home
You reach a state of your mind
Where it's madness to look and to find
Your false affections so kind
Please go home
Won't you please go home"

Mother's Little Helper Lyrics","[Intro]
What a drag it is getting old

[Verse 1]
Things are different today"", I hear every mother say
Mother needs something today to calm her down
And though she's not really ill, there's a little yellow pill

[Refrain]
She goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day

[Verse 2]
""Things are different today"", I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for a husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake and she burns a frozen steak

[Refrain]
And goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And to help her on her way, get her through her busy day

[Chorus]
Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

[Verse 3]
""Men just aren't the same today"", I hear every mother say
""They just don't appreciate that you get tired""
""They're so hard to satisfy"", you can tranquilize your mind

[Refrain]
So go running for the shelter of your mother's little helper
And four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight

[Chorus]
Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

[Verse 4]
""Life's just much too hard today"", I hear ev'ry mother say
The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
And if you take more of those, you will get an overdose

[Refrain]
No more running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
They just helped you on your way through your busy dying day

Hey"

Take It Or Leave It Lyrics","[Verse 1]
You can turn off and on more times
Than a flashing neon sign
When you want you're bad
But you can be so kind

[Chorus]
Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend just what you're going to do now
You take it or leave it
It's just my life

[Verse 2]
There've been times when you tried makin' eyes
At all my so called friends
Then you go, now you're back
But you can be so kind

[Chorus]
Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friends just what you're going to do now
You take it or leave it
It's just my life

Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la la la
Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la
Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la la la
Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la

[Verse 3]
I'm sick and tired of the smile that you give
When you don't come home at night
You said you'd call, that's a lie
But you could be so kind

[Chorus]
Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friends just what you're going to do now
You take it or leave it
It's just my life

Ride On, Baby Lyrics","[Verse 1]
A smile on your face
But not in your eyes
You're looking through me
You don't feel it inside

[Chorus]
Get out and ride on, baby, ride on, baby
Ride on, baby, ride on, baby
I could pick your face out in an FBI file
You may look pretty but I can't say the same for your mind
Ah ah ah

[Verse 2]
You walk up to me
And try to look shy
The red round your eyes
Says that you isn’t a child
Get out and ride on, baby, ride on, baby
Ride on, baby, ride on, baby
Well I’ve seen your face in a trashy magazine
You know where you're going but I don't like the places you've been
Ah ah ah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Laugh it a bit
Give it a try
If I’m not impressed
You can still cry
Get out and ride on, baby, ride on, baby
Ride on, baby, ride on, baby
By the time your thirty going to look sixty-five
You won't look pretty and your friends will have kissed you goodbye
Ride on, baby
Ride on, baby"

Sittin' On A Fence Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Since I was young I’ve been very hard to please
And I don't know wrong from right
But there is one thing i could never understand
Some of the sick things that a girl does to a man, so

[Chorus]
I'm still sittin' on a fence
You can say I got no sense
Trying to make up my mind
Really is too horrifying
So I’m sittin' on a fence

[Verse 2]
All of my friends at school grew up and settled down
And they mortgaged up their lives
One things not said too much, but I think it's true
They just get married cause there's nothing else to do, so

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
The day can come when you get old and sick and tired of life
You just never realize
Maybe the choice you made wasn't really right
But you go out and you don't come back at night, so

[Chorus]"
