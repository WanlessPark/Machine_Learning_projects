19th Nervous Breakdown Lyrics","[Verse 1]
You're the kind of person
You meet at certain dismal dull affairs
Center of a crowd, talking much too loud
Running up and down the stairs
Well, it seems to me that you have seen too much in too few years
And though you've tried you just can't hide
Your eyes are edged with tears

[Chorus 1]
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

[Verse 2]
When you were a child
You were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax

[Chorus 1]
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

[Chorus 2]
Oh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane
Well nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse. Oh please

[Verse 3]
You were still in school
When you had that fool
Who really messed your mind
And after that you turned your back
On treating people kind
On our first trip
I tried so hard to rearrange your mind
But after while I realized you were disarranging mine

[Chorus 1]
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

[Chorus 2]
Oh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane
Well nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse. Oh please

When you were a child
You were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax
You better stop
Look around

[Outro]
Here comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown"

(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Lyrics","[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Verse 1]
When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no - oh no, no, no!
Hey hey hey! That's what I say!

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Verse 2]
When I'm watching my TV
And that man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Outro]
When I'm riding round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby, better come back, maybe next week
Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey! That's what I say!"

Fortune teller Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Went to the fortune teller
Had my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head
Then she took a look at my palm
She said, Sonny, you feel kind of warm
And she looked into her crystal ball
And said, You're in love
I said, I couldn't be so
I'm not in passion with the girls I know
She said, When the next one arrives
You'll be looking into her eyes
I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me a lie
I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she make a fool out of me
Then something struck me
As if they came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love

[Chorus][x2]
Now I'm a happy fellow
Well, I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we could be
Now I get my fortune told for free"

I've Been Loving You Too Long Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I've been loving you too long to stop now
You were tied and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger as you become a haven to me
I've been loving you a little too long, I can't stop now
With you my life has been so wonderful, I can't stop now
You were tied and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, affair grows old
I've been loving you, my, my, my, my a little too long
I don't want to stop now, oh, oh
I've been loving you a little too long, I can't stop now
Oh, oh, I can't, I can't stop now
Don't make me stop me now
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late
I can't stop, I can't stop now
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Don't leave me now, my, my, my
I can't, I can't stop loving you now
No, no, no
My, my, my, my, my, my"

Under My Thumb Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Under my thumb the girl who once had me down
Under my thumb the girl who once pushed me around

[Chorus]
It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Say it's all right

[Verse 2]
Under my thumb the squirming dog who's just had her day
Under my thumb a girl who has just changed her ways

[Chorus]
It's down to me, yes it is
The way she does just what she's told
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Ah, ah, say it's alright

[Verse 3]
Under my thumb a Siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb she's the sweetest, hmmm, pet in the world

[Chorus]
It's down to me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

[Instrumental Break]
Ah, take it easy babe

[Chorus]
It's down to me, oh yeah
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Yeah, it feels alright

[Verse 4]
Under my thumb her eyes are just kept to herself
Under my thumb, well I, I can still look at someone else

[Chorus]
It's down to me, oh that's what I said
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

[Outro]
Say, it's alright
Say it's all...
Say it's all...

Take it easy babe
Take it easy babe
It feels alright
Take it, take it easy, babe"

Get Off of My Cloud Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I live on an apartment
On the ninety-ninth floor of my block
And I sit at home looking out the window
Imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy
Who's all dressed up just like the Union Jack
And says, I've won five pounds
If I have his kind of detergent pack

[Chorus]
I said, ""Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby""

[Verse 2]
The telephone is ringing
I say, ""Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?""
A voice says, ""Hi, hello, how are you?""
Well, I guess I'm doing fine
It's three a.m., there's too much noise
Don't you people ever want to go to bed
Because you feel so good
Do you have to drive me out of my head

[Chorus]
I said, ""Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby""

[Verse 3]
I was sick and tired, fed up with this
And decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out
I was so tired and I started to dream
In the morning the parking tickets were just like a flag
Stuck on my windscreen

[Chorus]
I said, ""Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby""

[Outro]
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around, baby two's a crowd
On my cloud"

Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? Lyrics","[Chorus]
Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Have you had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

[Verse 1]
I'm glad I opened your eyes
The have-nots would have tried to freeze you in ice

[Chorus]
Have you seen your brother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Have you had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

[Verse 2]
Well, I was just passing the time
I'm all alone, won't you give all your sympathy to mine?

[Bridge]
Tell me a story about how you adore me
Live in the shadow, see through the shadow
Glimpse through the shadow, tear at the shadow
Hate in the shadow, and love in your shadowy life

[Chorus]
Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Has he had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

[Verse 3]
Just where have you been all your life?
Talking about all the people who would try anything twice

[Chorus]
Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Has she had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

[Verse 4]
Well, you take your choice at the time
The brave old world or the slide to the depths of decline"

The Last Time Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well I told you once and I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know it should be easy

[Chorus]
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know. Oh no. Oh no

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm sorry girl but I can't stay
Feeling like I do today
It's too much pain and too much sorrow
Guess I'll feel the same tomorrow

Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know. Oh no. Oh no
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know. Oh no. Oh no

Well I told you once and I told you twice
That someone will have to pay the price
But here's a chance to change your mind
Because I'll be gone a long, long time

Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
Oh no. Oh no

My sweet Lady Jane, when I see you again
Your servant am I and will humbly remain
Just heed this plea, my love
On bended knees, my love
I pledge myself to lady Jane

My dear lady Anne, I've done what I can
I must take my leave for promised I am

The sands have run out for your lady and me
When luck is nigh, my love
Her station's right, my love
Life is secure with lady Jane"
