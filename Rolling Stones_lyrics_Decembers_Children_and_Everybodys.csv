Talkin' About You Lyrics","[Chorus 1]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
I met her walking down an uptown street
She's so fine I wish she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet

[Chorus 2]
Talking about you
(Nobody but you, baby)
Nobody but you
(Yes, you all the time)
I do mean you
(Yeah, my baby)
Just trying to get a message to you

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
Help me know she looks so good
Lovely skin, well shes soaked in gin
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood

[Chorus 2][x2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Talking about you
(Yeah, talk)
Nobody but you
(Yes, my my baby)
I do mean you
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm just trying to get a message through
Talking about my baby"

You Better Move On Lyrics","[Verse 1]
You ask me to give up the hand of the girl I love
You tell me, I'm not the man she's worthy of
But who are you to tell her who to love?
That's up to her, yes, and the Lord above
You better move on

[Verse 2]
Well, I know you can buy her fancy clothes and diamond rings
But I believe she's happy with me, without those things
Still you beg me to set her free
But, my friend, that will never be
You better move on

[Bridge]
Now I don't blame you for loving her
But can't you understand, man, she's my girl
And I, I'm never never ever gonna let her go
Because I, yeah, I love her so

[Verse 3]
I think you better go now, I'm getting mighty mad
You ask me to give up the only love I've ever had
Maybe I would, oh, but I love her so
I'm never gonna let her go
You better move on

[Outro]
You better move on[x3]"

Look What You've Done Lyrics","[Verse]
Now look what you've done
Now look what you've done
Look what you've done, baby
Now look what you've done
You left me here
The lonely one
And all I can say
Is look what you've done
A broken heart
A worried mind
Because of you, baby
Dying all the time
I once had a dream
But now I've none
Your taking your love
And see what it done
I saw you last night
Out moving round
With your new turf
You paint the town
That is okay
You're having your fun
Because some day
They call you done
And now your bird cries
The shadow falls
Gloomy memories
And I recall

[Outro]
Your love is my life
As warm as the sun
But now it is gone
And see what it done"

The Singer Not The Song Lyrics","[Verse]
Everywhere you want I always go
I always give in because, babe, you know
You just say so because you give me
That feeling inside that I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song
It's not the way you give in willingly
Others do it without thrilling me giving me
That same old feeling inside that I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song
The same old places and the same old songs
We've been going there for much too long
There's something wrong and it gives me that
Feeling inside that I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song

[Outro]
It's the singer not the song[x2]"

Route 66 Lyrics","[Intro]
Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way that is the highway that is the best

[Verse]
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well it winds from Chicago to L.A
More than 2000 miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

[Chorus][x2]
Well goes from St. Louie down to Missouri
Oklahoma city looks oh so pretty
You will see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66"

Get Off of My Cloud Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I live on an apartment
On the ninety-ninth floor of my block
And I sit at home looking out the window
Imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy
Who's all dressed up just like the Union Jack
And says, I've won five pounds
If I have his kind of detergent pack

[Chorus]
I said, ""Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby""

[Verse 2]
The telephone is ringing
I say, ""Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?""
A voice says, ""Hi, hello, how are you?""
Well, I guess I'm doing fine
It's three a.m., there's too much noise
Don't you people ever want to go to bed
Because you feel so good
Do you have to drive me out of my head

[Chorus]
I said, ""Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby""

[Verse 3]
I was sick and tired, fed up with this
And decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out
I was so tired and I started to dream
In the morning the parking tickets were just like a flag
Stuck on my windscreen

[Chorus]
I said, ""Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby""

[Outro]
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around, baby two's a crowd
On my cloud"

I'm Free Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I'm free to do what I want any old time
I'm free to do what I want any old time
So love me, hold me
Love me, hold me
But I'm free any old time to get what I want

[Verse 2]
I'm free to sing my song, though it gets out of time
I'm free to sing my song, though it gets out of time
So love me, hold me
Love me, hold me
But I'm free any old time to get what I want
Yeah

[Refrain]
Love me, hold me
Love me, hold me
And I'm free any old time to get what I want

[Verse 3]
I'm free to choose whom I please any old time
I'm free to please whom I choose any old time
So hold me, love me
Love me, hold me
I'm free any old time to get what I want, yes I am"

As Tears Go By Lyrics","[Chorus]
It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see
But not for me
I sit and watch
As tears go by

[Verse]
My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
All I hear is the sound
Of rain falling on the ground
I sit and watch
As tears go by

[Chorus]
It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Doing things I used to do
They think are new
I sit and watch
As tears go by"
"
Gotta Get Away Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Baby, the truth is out so don't deny
Baby to think I believed all your lies
Darlin' I can't stand to see your face
It's the truth, you understand

[Chorus]
I got to get away, got to get away
Got to, got to, got to get away
Got to get away

[Verse 2]
Baby, I don't want to live here no more
Baby, though I tore your pictures off my walls
Darling this old room's falling in on me
You understand the truth now

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Baby, oh, how could you take away your clothes
Baby, don't screw up this old heart of gold
Darling, this will rule my social flare
You understand me now

[Chorus]"

Blue Turns to Grey Lyrics","[Verse 1]
So now that she is gone
You won't be sad for long
For maybe just an hour or just a moment
Of the day

[Chorus]
Then blue turns to grey
And try as you may
You just don't feel good
You don't feel alright
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her

[Verse 2]
You think you'll have a ball
And you won't care at all
You'll find another girl or maybe more
To pass the time away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She's not home when you call
So you can go to all
The places where she used to go
But she has gone away

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Blue turns to grey (blue turns to grey)
She has gone away (blue turns to grey)
I feel so bad (blue turns to grey)
I wish you'd come on home (blue turns to grey)
I feel, I feel so down"
"
I'm Moving On Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I warned you baby from time to time
You don't listen so pay me no mind
About moving on
Yeah I'm moving on
I'm through with you
Too bad you're blue
I'll move on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Mister Engineer with your throttle in hand
Take me back to that Southern land
It called moving
Keep a rolling on
You're flying too high

[Chorus]
For my old sky
I'll move on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Mister Fireman please won't you listen to me
I got a woman in Tennessee
Keep on moving
Keep a rolling on
You're flying too high

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Yes I'm going to move
I'm going to move
Said I'm gonna move
Got to go home
I got to go home
I got to go home
Well tell you

[Outro]
I I I I'm going home
I I I I'm going home
I I I I'm going home
I've got to go home
I've got to  go baby
I got to keep rolling
And I'm going to move
I said I'm going to move baby
I said going going home
I'm going home darling"
