Jumpin' Jack Flash Lyrics","(Instrumental Intro)

One two!
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at the maw in the drivin' rain
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
Yeah, yeah
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread.
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head
My, my, yeah
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas"

Carol Lyrics","[Chorus]
Oh, Carol
Do not let him steal your heart away
I am going to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

[Verse]
Climb into my machine so we can groove on out
I know some swinging little joint where we can jump and shout
It is not too far back on the highway not so long a ride
You park the car out in the open you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her ma'am
Because every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed
Oh, Carol
Do not let him steal your heart away
I am going to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day
Now, if you want to hear some music like the boys are playing
Hold tight, bang your foot do not let it carry you away
Do not let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Will the music intrigue you when they get a crowd
Well you cannot dance I know you would you could
I got my eyes on you, baby, cause you dance so good

[Chorus][x2]"

Stray Cat Blues Lyrics","[Intro]
Ah... hey
Yeah, cat's own tail

[Verse 1]
I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
I know you're no scared-eyed honey
There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs

[Refrain]
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Verse 2]
I can see that you're fifteen years old
No I don't want your I.D
And I can see that you're so far from home

[Refrain]
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet, bet your mama don't know you scream like that
I bet your mother don't know you can spit like that

[Verse 3]
You look so weird and you're so far from home
Bet you really miss your mother
Don't look so scared I'm no mad-brained bear

[Refrain]
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Woo!
I bet your mama don't know that you scratch like that
I bet she don't know you can bite like that

[Verse 4]
You say you got a friend, that she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs?
If she's so wild then she can join in too

[Refrain]
It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet you mama don't know you can bite like that
I'll bet she never saw you scratch my back"

Love In Vain Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Yeah, I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Whoa, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
When all your love's in vain

[Verse 2]
When the train come in the station
I looked her in the eye
Well the train come in the station
And I looked her in the eye
Whoa, I felt so sad so lonesome
That I could not help but cry

[Verse 3]
When the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Yeah, when the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Whoa, the blue light was my baby
And the red light was my mind

[Outro]
All my love was in vain
All my love's in vain"

Midnight Rambler Lyrics","{​Intro}​

[Verse 1]
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Everybody got to go
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
The one that shut the kitchen door
He don't give a hoot of warning
Wrapped up in a black cat cloak
He don't go in the light of the morning
He split the time the cock'rel crows

[Verse 2]
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Did you see him jump the garden wall
Sighin' down the wind so sad
Listen and you'll hear him moan
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Everybody got to go

{​Bridge}​

[Verse 3]
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
Well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Yeah, the one you never seen before

{​Bridge}​

Oh don't do that, oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Oh don't do that, oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that

{​Bridge}​

[Verse 4]
Well, you heard about the Boston…
It’s not one of those…
Well, talkin' 'bout the midnight...sh...
The one that closed the bedroom door
I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger
The knife-sharpened tippie-toe...
Or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler
You know, the one you never seen before

[Verse 5]
So if you ever meet the midnight rambler
Coming down your marble hall
Well he's pouncing like proud black panther
Well, you can say I, I told you so
Well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler, yeah
Play it easy, as you go
I'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows
Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door

{​Bridge}​

[Verse 6]
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
And did you hear about the midnight gambler
And did you see me make my midnight call
And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
I'll steal your mistress from under your nose
I'll go easy with your cold fanged anger
I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby
And it hurts!"

Sympathy for the Devil Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 2]
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 3]
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

Oh yeah, get down heavy!
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Variation]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game

[Verse 4]
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

Live With Me Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I got nasty habits
I take tea at three
Yes, and the meat I eat for dinner
It must be hung up for a week

My best friend, he shoots water rats
And feeds them to his geese
Don't you think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?

[Chorus]
Come on now, honey
We can build a home for three
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?

[Verse 2]
And there's a score of harebrained children
They're all locked in the nursery
They got earphone heads, they got dirty necks
They're so 20th century

Well they queue up for the bathroom
Around about 7:35
Don't you think we need a woman's touch
To make it come alive?

[Chorus]
You'd look good
Pram-pushing down the high street
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?

[Verse 3]
Whoa, the servants they're so helpful, dear
The cook she is a whore
Yes, the butler has a place for her
Behind the pantry door

The maid, she's French, she's got no sense
She's from the Crazy Horse
And when she strips, the chauffeur flips
The footman's eyes get crossed

[Outro]
Dont you think there's a place for us
Right across the street
Don'cha think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?"

Little queenie Lyrics","[Intro]
(Aw New York City you've talked a lot, let's have a look at you)

[Verse 1]
I got the lumps in my throat
When I saw her coming down the aisle
I gets the wiggles in my knees
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
There she is again standing over by the record machine
Oh, she's looking like a model on the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

[Chorus 1]
Meanwhile, I was thinking
She's in the mood
No need to break it
I got the chance
I ought to take it
She can dance
We can make it
Come on queenie
Let's shake it

[Chorus 2]
Go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie

[Verse 2]
Won't you tell me who the queen's
Standing over by the record machine
Why she's looking like a model
On the cover of a magazine
Yeah she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen
(Take off your shoes)

[Chorus 1]
Meanwhile, I was still thinking
If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
If it's a rocker, that'll get it
If it's good, she'll admit it

[Chorus 2]"

Honky Tonk Women Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
Cause I just can't seem to drink it off my mind

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

[Verse 2]
I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me with roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

[Verse 3]
Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris
Naked as the day that I will die
The sailors, they're so charming there in Paris
But I just don't seem to sail you off my mind

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues"

Street Fighting Man Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy
Because summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street boy
But what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band

[Chorus]
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!

[Verse 2]
Hey! Think the time is right for a Palace Revolution
But where I live the game to play is Compromise Solution!
Well then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band

[Chorus]
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!

[Verse 3]
Hey! Said my name is called Disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the King I'll rail at all his servants
Well then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band

[Chorus]
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!"

Prodigal Son Lyrics","[Verse]
Well a poor boy took his father's bread and started down the road
Started down the road
Took all he had and started down the road
Going out in this world, where God only knows
And that'll be the way to get along
Well poor boy spent all he had, famine come in the land
Famine come in the land
Spent all he had and famine come in the land
Said, ""I believe I'll go and hire me to some man""
And that'll be the way I'll get along
Well, man said, ""I'll give you a job for to feed my swine
For to feed my swine
I'll give you a job for to feed my swine""
Boy stood there and hung his head and cried
Because that is no way to get along
Said, ""I believe I'll ride, believe I'll go back home
Believe I'll go back home
Believe I'll ride, believe I'll go back home
Or down the road as far as I can go""
And that'll be the way to get along
Well, father said, ""See my son coming after me
Coming home to me""
Father ran and fell down on his knees
Said, Sing and praise, Lord have mercy on me
Mercy
Oh poor boy stood there, hung his head and cried
Hung his head and cried
Poor boy stood and hung his head and cried
Said, Father will you look on me as a child?
Yeah
Well father said, ""Eldest son, kill the fatted calf
Call the family round
Kill that calf and call the family round
My son was lost but now he is found
Because that's the way for us to get along""

You got to move

Who walks the street
You see that police
Upon his beat
But then the Lord gets ready
You got to move

Under My Thumb Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Under my thumb the girl who once had me down
Under my thumb the girl who once pushed me around

It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Say it's all right

Under my thumb the squirming dog who's just had her day
Under my thumb a girl who has just changed her ways

The way she does just what she's told
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Ah, ah, say it's alright

Under my thumb a Siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb she's the sweetest, hmmm, pet in the world

Under my thumb, well I, I can still look at someone else

(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Lyrics","[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination

And that man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try

When I'm riding round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby, better come back, maybe next week
Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey! That's what I say!"
