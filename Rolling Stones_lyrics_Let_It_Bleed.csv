Gimme Shelter Lyrics","[Intro: Merry Clayton]
Oooooh

[Verse 1: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
Ooh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

[Chorus: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

[Verse 2: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
Ooh, see the fire is sweeping
Our very street today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost your way

[Chorus: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

[Verse 3: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
Mmm, the floods is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm going to fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

I tell you love, sister
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, (kiss away kiss away)

Love In Vain Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Yeah, I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Whoa, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
When all your love's in vain

[Verse 2]
When the train come in the station
I looked her in the eye
Well the train come in the station
And I looked her in the eye
Whoa, I felt so sad so lonesome
That I could not help but cry

[Verse 3]
When the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Yeah, when the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Whoa, the blue light was my baby
And the red light was my mind

[Outro]
All my love was in vain
All my love's in vain"

Country Honk Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' in a bar, tippin' a jar in Jackson
And on the street the summer sun it shines
There's many a barroom queen
I've had in Jackson
But I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

[Verse 2]
I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady she all dressed me up in roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Give me, Give me, Give me the honky tonk blues

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues"

Live With Me Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I got nasty habits
I take tea at three
Yes, and the meat I eat for dinner
It must be hung up for a week

My best friend, he shoots water rats
And feeds them to his geese
Don't you think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?

[Chorus]
Come on now, honey
We can build a home for three
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?

[Verse 2]
And there's a score of harebrained children
They're all locked in the nursery
They got earphone heads, they got dirty necks
They're so 20th century

Well they queue up for the bathroom
Around about 7:35
Don't you think we need a woman's touch
To make it come alive?

[Chorus]
You'd look good
Pram-pushing down the high street
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?

[Verse 3]
Whoa, the servants they're so helpful, dear
The cook she is a whore
Yes, the butler has a place for her
Behind the pantry door

The maid, she's French, she's got no sense
She's from the Crazy Horse
And when she strips, the chauffeur flips
The footman's eyes get crossed

[Outro]
Dont you think there's a place for us
Right across the street
Don'cha think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?"

Let It Bleed Lyrics","[Chorus]
Well, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, you can lean on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, you can lean on me

[Verse 1]
She said, ""My breasts, they will always be open
Baby, you can rest your weary head right on me
And there will always be a space in my parking lot
When you need a little coke and sympathy""

[Chorus]
Yeah, we all need someone we can dream on
And if you want it, baby, well you can dream on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can cream on
And if you want to, well you can cream on me

[Verse 2]
I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement
When you drunk my health in scented jasmine tea
But you knifed me in my dirty, filthy basement
With that jaded, faded, junky nurse - oh what pleasant company

[Chorus]
Come on, we all need someone we can feed on
Yeah, and if you want it, well you can feed on me
Hey, take my arm, take my leg
Oh baby, don't you take my head

[Chorus]
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, and if you want it, baby, well you can bleed on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, and if you want it, baby, why don't you bleed on me (All over)

[Verse 3]
Ah, get it on rider, get it on rider, get it on rider
You can bleed all over me, yeah
Get it on rider, get it on rider, yeah
You can be my rider, you can come all over me, oh
Get it on rider, get it on rider, get it on rider
You can come all over me"

Midnight Rambler Lyrics","{​Intro}​

[Verse 1]
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Everybody got to go
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
The one that shut the kitchen door
He don't give a hoot of warning
Wrapped up in a black cat cloak
He don't go in the light of the morning
He split the time the cock'rel crows

[Verse 2]
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Did you see him jump the garden wall
Sighin' down the wind so sad
Listen and you'll hear him moan
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Everybody got to go

{​Bridge}​

[Verse 3]
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
Well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Yeah, the one you never seen before

{​Bridge}​

Oh don't do that, oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Oh don't do that, oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that

{​Bridge}​

[Verse 4]
Well, you heard about the Boston…
It’s not one of those…
Well, talkin' 'bout the midnight...sh...
The one that closed the bedroom door
I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger
The knife-sharpened tippie-toe...
Or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler
You know, the one you never seen before

[Verse 5]
So if you ever meet the midnight rambler
Coming down your marble hall
Well he's pouncing like proud black panther
Well, you can say I, I told you so
Well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler, yeah
Play it easy, as you go
I'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows
Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door

{​Bridge}​

[Verse 6]
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
And did you hear about the midnight gambler
And did you see me make my midnight call
And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
I'll steal your mistress from under your nose
I'll go easy with your cold fanged anger
I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby
And it hurts!"

You Got the Silver Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Hey babe, what's in your eyes?
I saw them flashing like airplane lights
You fill my cup, babe, that's for sure
I must come back for a little more

[Verse 2]
You got my heart you got my soul
You got the silver you got the gold
You got the diamonds from the mine
Well that's all right, it'll buy some time

[Verse 3]
Tell me, honey, what will I do
When I'm hungry and thirsty too
I'm feeling foolish and that's for sure
Just waiting here at your kitchen door?

[Verse 4]
Hey baby, what's in your eyes?
Is that the diamonds from the mine?
What's that laughing in your smile?
I don't care, no, I don't care

[Verse 5]
Oh babe, you got my soul
You got the silver, you got the gold
You got your love, just leave me blind
I don't care, no, that's no big surprise"
"
Monkey Man Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I'm a fleabit peanut monkey
All my friends are junkies
That's not really true

I'm a cold Italian pizza
I could use a lemon squeezer
You could do?

Well, I've been bit and I've been tossed around
By every she-rat in this town
Have you, babe?

[Refrain]
Well, I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey woman too

[Verse 2]
I was bitten by a boar
I was gouged and I was gored
But I pulled on through

Yes, I'm a sack of broken eggs
I always have an unmade bed
Don't you?

Well, I hope we're not too messianic
Or a trifle too satanic
We love to play the blues

[Refrain]
Well I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey, monkey woman
Monkey woman too, babe!

[Outro]
I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey!
I'm a monkey man!  I'm a monkey man!
I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey!
Monkey! monkey! monkey!"

You Can't Always Get What You Want Lyrics","[Intro: London Bach Choir]
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man
No, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime
You'll find
You get what you need

[Verse 1]
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you  might find
You get what you need

[Verse 2]
And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, ""We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't, we're going to blow a 50-amp fuse""

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you just might find
You get what you need

[Verse 3]
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was ""dead""
I said to him:

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you just might find
You get what you need

[Verse 4]
You get what you need, yeah, oh baby
I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands

[Outro]
You can't always get what you want, yeah
You can't always get what you want, ooh yeah
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you just might find
You just might find you get what you need, ah yeah
Ah yeah
Wooh!
Ah you can't always get what you want (no no)
You can't always get what you want (you can't no no)
You can't always get what you want
...mmm but if you try sometimes, you just might find
You just might find you get what you need
Ah yeah!
Ah yeah! Yeah"
