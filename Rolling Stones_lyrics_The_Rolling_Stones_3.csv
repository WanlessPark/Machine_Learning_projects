Everybody Needs Somebody To Love Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I'm so glad to be here tonight and I'm so glad to be home
And I believe I've got a message
For every woman and every man here tonight
That ever needed somebody to love
Someone to stay with them all the time
When they're up and when they're down
You know, sometimes you get what you want
And then you go and lose what you have
And I believe every woman and every man here tonight
Listen to my song and it save the whole world. Listen to me

[Bridge]
Everybody wants somebody
Everybody wants somebody to love
Someone to love
Someone to kiss
Sometime to miss, now
Someone to squeeze
Someone to please
And I need you you you
I need you you you
I need you you you
I need you you you

[Verse 2]
Oh, sometimes I feel like
I feel a little sad inside
My baby mistreats me
And I kind of get a little little mad

To see me through baby
In the morning time too
When the sun goes down

Down Home Girl Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Lord I swear the perfume you wear
Was made out of turnip greens
And every time I kiss you girl
It tastes like pork and beans
Even though you are wearing them
Citified high heels
I can tell by your giant step
You been walking through the cotton fields

[Chorus]
Oh, you are so down home girl
Every time you monkey child
You take my breath away
And every time you move like that
I got to get down and pray

[Verse 2]
Do you know that dress of yours
Was made out of fiberglass?
And every time you move like that
I got to go to Sunday mass

[Chorus]
Oh, you are so down home girl
Oh, you are so down home girl

[Verse 3]
I am going to take you to the muddy river
And push you in
Just to watch the water roll on
Down your velvet skin
I am going to take you back to New Orleans
Down in Dixieland
I am going to watch you do the second line
With an umbrella in your hand

[Chorus]
Oh, you are so down home girl
I am with you baby
You are so down home
Ow! Yeah, too much
Out off sight
You are so down home girl"

You Can't Catch Me Lyrics","[Verse 1]
I bought a brand new air mobile
It was custom made
It was a Flight Deville
With an outboard motor
And some hideaway wings
Push in on the button and you can hear her sing

[Chorus]
Now you cannot catch me
No, baby, you cannot catch me
Cause if you get too close
You know I am gone like a cool breeze

[Verse 2]
New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours
I was rolling slowly cause of drizzling' showers
Up come a flattop he was moving up with me
Then come sailing goodbye
In a little old supped up mini
I put my foot in my tank and I begin to roll
Moaning sirens, was the state patrol
So I get out my wings and then I blew my horn
Bye-bye New Jersey I become airborne

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Flying with my baby last Saturday night
Was no gray cloud floating in sight
Big full moon shining up above
Cuddle up honey be my love
Sweetest little thing that I ever seen
I am going to name you Maybelline
Flying with all the things set on flight control
Radio tuned to rock and roll
Two, three hours passing by
Altitude dropped to 505
Fuel consumption way too fast
Let us get on home before we run out of gas

[Chorus]"

Time Is on My Side Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is
Now you always say
That you want to be free

But you'll come running back (said you would baby)
You'll come running back (I said so many times before)
You'll come running back to me
Oh, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is
You're searching for good times

[Chorus]
But just wait and see
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more)
You'll come running back (spend the rest of my life with you, baby)
You'll come running back to me
Go ahead, go ahead and light up the town

[Verse 2]
And baby, do everything your heart desires
Remember, I'll always be around
And I know, I know
Like I told you so many times before
You're going to come back, baby
Because I know
You're going to come back knocking
Yeah, knocking right on my door
Yes, yes!
Well, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is
Cause I got the real love
The kind that you need

You'll come running back (said you would, baby)
You'll come running back (I don't always said you would)
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more)

What A Shame Lyrics","[Intro]
What a shame
Nothing seems to be going right
What a shame
Nothing seems to be going right
It seems easy to me that everything can be alright

[Chorus]
What a shame
They always want to start a fight
What a shame
They always want to start a fight

Well it scares me so
I could sleep in the shelter all night
Well alright

What a shame
You all heard what I said
What a shame
Y'all heard what I said

You might wake up in the morning
And find your poor self dead"

Grown Up Wrong Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well, you've grown up all wrong, well you've grown up all wrong
You come on too strong, well you've grown up all wrong
Well, you were easy to fool when you were in school
But you've grown up all wrong

[Guitar solo]

Well, you've grown up on me, well you've grown up on me
Don't believe what I see, well you've grown up on me
Well, you look so sweet when you're in your jeans
But you've grown up on me, raise your hands

[Guitar solo]

Well, you've grown up too fast, well you've grown up too fast
Don't forget about the past, girl you've grown up too fast
Well you won't be a fool but I'm through with you
Well, you've grown up too fast, well you've grown up too fast"

Down The Road Apiece Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Now, if you want to hear some boogie like I am going to play
It is just an old piano and a knockout bass
The drummer's man's a cat, they call Charlie McCoy
You know, remember that rubber legged boy?
Mama, cooking chicken fried and bacon grease
Come on along boys, it is just down the road apiece

[Chorus][x2]
Well there is a place you really get your kicks
It is open every night about twelve to six
Now if you want to hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece"

Under the Boardwalk Lyrics","[Verse 1]
When the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby

[Chorus]
Is where I'll be
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We were falling in love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)

[Verse 2]
On the park you'll hear
The happy sound of a carousel
You can almost taste the hot dogs
And french fries they sell
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby

[Chorus]
Is where I'll be
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We were falling in love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)
Oh, under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby

[Chorus]"

I Can't Be Satisfied Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Well, I'm going away to live
Won't be back no more
Going back down south, child

Woman I'm trouble
Trouble and all worried mind

Well, I feel like snapping
Pistol in your face
Going to let some graveyard

Yeah, I'm all in my sleep
Hear my doorbell ring
Looking for my baby

That old train be late man
Lord I come walking out

Pain In My Heart Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Pain in my heart
Treating me poor
Where can my baby be?
Lord, no one knows
Pain in my heart

And one day
My days are getting tough
Will  you come back, come back, come back, baby

Off The Hook Lyrics","[Verse 1]
Sitting in my bedroom late last night
Got into bed and turned out the light
Decided to call my baby on the telephone
All I got was an engaged tone

[Chorus]
It is off the hook[x5]

[Verse 2]
Talking so long she upset my mind
Why is she talking such a long time?
Maybe she is sleeping, maybe she is ill
Phone is disconnected, unpaid bill

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Do not want to see her, afraid of what I would find
Tired of letting her upset me all the time
Back into bed started reading my books
Take my phone right off of the hook

[Chorus]"
